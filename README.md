```

This will set up Vibe on your machine. 

## Usage

Once installed, you can begin using Vibe to generate your files. Hereâ€™s a quick guide on how to get started:

### Generating Protobuf Files

To generate protobuf files, run the following command:

```bash
vibe generate protobuf --input <input_file> --output <output_directory>
```

Replace `<input_file>` with your source file and `<output_directory>` with your desired output path.

### Generating Prisma Schemas

To create a Prisma schema, use the command:

```bash
vibe generate prisma --input <input_file> --output <output_directory>
```

This will create a schema.prisma file that you can use in your project.

### Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example to illustrate how to use Vibe:

1. Create a new directory for your project.
2. Inside that directory, create a file named `example.proto`.
3. Add your protobuf definitions to `example.proto`.
4. Run the Vibe command:

```bash
vibe generate protobuf --input example.proto --output ./generated
```

This will generate the necessary files in the `generated` directory.
